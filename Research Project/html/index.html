            In the present world, it is possible for us to know different news and information
            from different parts of the world, easily. This is because of the invention of media. 
            With this invention,  we can gather information about a deadly war that is fought in the 
            other half of the world within moments. But, are all this information correct and trustable?
            How will be able to ensure whether the news is correct or not? It is said that a lie can make 
            the world change before people know the truth behind it. This is because we live in a post-truth era.
            An era where people are more likely to believe in information based on their emotions and personal beliefs.
            These are some of the challenging problems that many people face now.<br>

          Fact Check: How does AI( Artificial Intelligence) cause problems in journalism?
        </h2>

          We often use AI for constructive purposes. To make new applications that are useful for humanity. 
          But along with these useful applications, people can make something dangerous too. It is so evident
          from the fact that one of the masterminds of this century, Prof. Stephen Hawkings told to BBC that 
          "The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race." In journalism,
          AI is currently making massive problems by creating fake news, fake people, social media accounts, etc. 
          In 2018, there was a big issue that made a significant impact on cyber security and helped to learn more about AI.
          A student named Oliver Taylor who was in his twenties was pursuing at the University of Birmingham. 
          He was very active in social media publishing revolutionary thoughts about anti-semitism and Jewish affairs. 
          Once, this person(at least everyone thought to be) published an article in the newspaper Algemeiner
          about a Palestinian rights campaigner and her husband who was a senior lecturer at the University of London. 
          The article accused them for “known terrorist sympathizers”( Giansiracusa 18). When there was an inquiry regarding
          who Oliver Taylor was, it was found that this person never existed. Yes! The entire profile, photo, blogs, etc. was
          formed by an AI. If we think of the accused people, they might have suffered for at least one day from society.
          Even on social media, people might have insulted them. Although it was proved later that those people were not
          accused, it is very unlikely that this information would have reached all the people who believed the fake news.
          If this fake acquisition existed for more time, the life of the accused people will be different than what we can see today.
