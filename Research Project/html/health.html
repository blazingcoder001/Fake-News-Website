                This fake news was published by David “Avocado” Wolfe on his website Davidwolfe.com. 
                He had his own reasons for the argument.  The reasons for these are due to three different
                ingredients in the famous Reese brand- soy lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate(PGPR), and 
                tertiary butylhydroquinone(TBHQ). David had published many other sites as well.
                Almost all of them are click baits. But unlike most of the other click baits, this one is having a
                more serious heading. Also, since Reese's brand is famous all over the world. This post beat many 
                boundaries to become viral(Whitmire).<br><br>

              Here is a video that’s found on DavidWolfe.com explaining how to make a healthy vegan version
              of peanut butter. Clearly, we can understand that he was doing some marketing for the youtube
              video along with the clickbait as well.
