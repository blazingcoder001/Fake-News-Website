                ” News outlets around the world are reporting on the news that Pope Francis has made the unprecedented 
                decision to endorse a US presidential candidate. His statement in support of Donald Trump was released 
                from the Vatican this evening”(Evon).<br>

                In 2016, this news was published by WTOE 5 news website and got so much social media discussion. Pope 
                Francis responded that “I have been hesitant to offer any kind of support for either candidate in the
                US presidential election but I now feel that to not voice my concern would be a dereliction of my duty as the Holy See”.( Evon)<br><br>
