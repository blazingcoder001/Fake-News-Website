                A website called GSA news posted this story. They also stated that DiCaprio had maternal roots in Ukraine.
                 However, after further analysis, it was found that this news was fake and was posted without proper <br>
                 verification of the sources.(CNN Politics)<br>

                “DiCaprio did not make a $10 million donation to Ukraine and does not have a family member from Odesa or
                 anywhere else in Ukraine, a source close to the actor told CNN on Wednesday. The source said that DiCaprio
                 “stands with Ukraine” and has made Ukraine-related humanitarian donations to CARE, the International
                 Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN’s refugee agency – but that the reported $10 million sum is false,
                 that claims of DiCaprio giving money to the Ukrainian government or to the Ukrainian military are also false,
                 and that claims that DiCaprio has any “family ties” to Ukraine are false too”(CNN Politics).
